# Planets Database
This repository contains a small collection of files describing planets in our solar system.
It is used to practice Git and GitHub workflows including creating repositories, making commits,
and pushing changes to GitHub.

Fun fact: Venus is hotter than Mercury even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.
